            <h2>How Trisha AI Works</h2>
            <p>Running an Orangetheory studio involves juggling countless tasks across different apps and portals. Trisha AI brings it all together.</p>
            <p>How? Through a unique team of specialized AI agents working behind the scenes. You interact easily with <strong>Trisha</strong>, your primary AI assistant, via a simple chat interface. Forget digging through dashboards – just ask questions like:</p>
            <div class="example-queries">
                <blockquote>"What's our current profit margin?"</blockquote>
                <blockquote>"How many leads did we get yesterday?"</blockquote>
                <blockquote>"What's today's class schedule?"</blockquote>
                <blockquote>"Generate some local marketing ideas for Clearwater."</blockquote>
                <blockquote>"Who's closing the studio tonight?"</blockquote>
            </div>
            <p>Trisha intelligently understands your request and delegates the task to the right expert agent – <strong>CMO</strong> (Marketing), <strong>CSO</strong> (Sales), <strong>CFO</strong> (Finance), <strong>COO</strong> (Operations), or <strong>HRO</strong> (Human Resources) agent. These specialized agents then securely connect to your existing studio tools (like Mindbody, ADP, Orangebook, and the OTF Studio Portal) to execute the work or retrieve the information efficiently.</p>
            <p>It’s coordinated expertise and powerful automation, simplified.</p>
